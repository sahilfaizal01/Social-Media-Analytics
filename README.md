3. Desire (more testimonials, videos, images to attract more - buy now button in videos, free demo classes)
4. Action (buying the product

## Facebook Social Media Manager
### Facebook Campaign (Highest Hierarchy)
Each campaign can have multiple ad sets and each ad set can be created to target difference audience groups. Advertisers can also set budget at ad set level. Each ad set can have multiple ads. An ad may contain text, creatives, headlines and call to action.
Facebook will automatically rotate each ad type (video, image) to individual groups where the only difference is in the format. This helps the marketing team to conduct A/B tests by displaying two different ad variations to the same target. Eg: A for protein shake conversion campaign, we can have one adset to target fitness enthusiasts and other for health-conscious adults
The marketing team can decide where to place these ad sets also maybe facebook newsfeed and instagram newsfeed
FB's campaign budget optimizer allows distribution of budget across different adsets based on their performance (as we don't know which one will work beforehand)
<br> <b><i>Choosing a campaign helps Facebook customize your ads:</i></b>
* Awareness objective - Ad is shown to people who are likely to remember it
* Sales objective - Ad is shown to people who are more likely to buy it
### Objective:

## Types of Audience:
### 1. Core Audience
Allows advertisers to reach people who would be interested in their brand
Targeting people based on:
* Demographics
* Interests
* Behaviors
### 2. Custom Audience
A way of targeting people who have already interacted with your brand
<br> Eg: Companies can pass on the emails given by users for newsletters and transfer it to Facebook, who will then anonymize the email and match it with respective profiles
### 3. Lookalike Audience
Allows marketers to target people who are similar to existing users. Thus automatically identifies people who might be interested in your product without any extensive research.
<br> Eg: Provide data related to existing users then Facebook can provide similar profiles
### Meta Pixel

* User Actions
* Demographic
* Behaviour

## Social Media Marketing Metrics
1. Impressions
2. Link Clicks
3. Conversion Rate
- Significant drop offs at any of these stages should be closely monitored
- Drop-offs can be caused by bad user experience like slow-loading, time-consuming log in process etc.
### 1. Reach - the number of people who saw your Facebook ad
* A top funnel metric
* Allows us to assess campaign visibility
### 2. Impressions - the number of times an ad comes up on someone's timeline
* The number of impressions >= reach
* Must be tracked in awareness campaigns
* Higher impressions lead to higher brand recall
* However, people may get tired of seeing the ads too many times (Ad Fatigue)
* Thus advertisers must balance between high add visibility and ad fatigue
### 3. Click-Through-Rate (CTR) - displays the number of click to impressions
* The number of people who click on your ad for every person who sees it
* Lets you track how engaging you ad is
* A low CTR means your add is uncompelling and less relevant
### 4. Link Clicks - Number of ad clicks that led the user to a different destination
* Represents a subset of the total number of clicks your ad recieves
* Only considers clicks that takes the users to a follow-up page/destination
* Helps to track how effectively the ad is driving users to desired destination
### 5. Conversion Rate = Desired Action
* Can be a purchase, newsletter subscription, adding to cart, e-book download
* Conversion Rate = Conversions / Link Clicks
### 6. Cost per mille (CPM) - The amount you are paying for every 1000 impressions
* A high CPM means you are paying too much for people to see your ads - shows your ad isn't relevant to target audience, target audience is too narrow or high competition
* A high CPM isn't always bad if running consideration or conversion campaign - people at the bottom of the marketing funnel has high purchasing potential
* Facebook optimizes CPM in awareness campaigns
### 7. Cost-Per-Link-Click (CPC) - The amount you pay for clicks on your ad
* A high CPC means you are paying too much for people to see your ads - shows your ad isn't relevant to target audience, content isn't engaging
* Facebook optimizes CPC in engagement campaigns
* Should be tracked for performing A/B tests (CPC image vs video)
### 8. Cost-Per-Result (CPR) or Cost-Per-Acquisition or Cost-Per-Conversion - the amount you pay for each conversion
* CPR = Amount Spend / Total Number of Sales
* Facebook optimizes CPR in conversion campaigns
### 9. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) - The revenue generated for every dollar you spend
* Total Ad Revenue / Total Ad Spend
* ROAS and ROI is not similar
* ROAS - evaluates return from a specific campaign, Only ad cost considered
* ROI - evaluates profitability from an entire project, All costs are considered (R&D, Equipment etc.)
* Difficult to calculated ROAS, as some campaigns takes more time and won't generate revenue immediately
* Set a reasonable time frame before calculating ROAS
