## Facebook Social Media Manager
### Facebook Campaign (Highest Hierarchy)
Each campaign can have multiple ad sets and each ad set can be created to target difference audience groups. Advertisers can also set budget at ad set level. Each ad set can have multiple ads. An ad may contain text, creatives, headlines and call to action.
Facebook will automatically rotate each ad type (video, image) to individual groups where the only difference is in the format. This helps the marketing team to conduct A/B tests by displaying two different ad variations to the same target. Eg: A for protein shake conversion campaign, we can have one adset to target fitness enthusiasts and other for health-conscious adults
The marketing team can decide where to place these ad sets also maybe facebook newsfeed and instagram newsfeed
FB's campaign budget optimizer allows distribution of budget across different adsets based on their performance (as we don't know which one will work beforehand)
